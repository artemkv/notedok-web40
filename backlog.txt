- --If the note is plain text, it has a small marker ".txt" next to it in the note list (in place of orbit indicator)--
- --When orbit indicator is visible, it replaces the marker--
- --If the note is plain text, it is converted to HTML and rendered as in the legacy version--
- --When you go into editing, instead of markdown editor, you have text area--
- --The rest works the same--
- Show plain text note visually as deleted when appropriate

- The note list is only shown when the browser window is wide enough; otherwise it is hidden


Technical notes:

- when clicked save, but no changes, nothing happens, but editor is still editable
- except if you just load note, then edit-save, saves something, I don't know what
- it's strange that new note has "Save" available (because is editable by default), but then you move away and it disappears (as editor stops being editable)

- Support .txt files (plain text editor)
- MD rendering sometimes fails, need to catch it and allow switching to text

- handle all the errors
- update the model arrows (from errors to normal states)

- double-check: correct note item for all note states
- double-check: correct editor state for all note states

- unit-tests
- todos


Not sure if possible:

- Text placeholder for an existing and new note is "No text"
- You can cancel md editing by clicking `Esc`


Later versions:

- make layout responsive and shown correctly on mobile
- extract layout css into a single place
- use ems/rems?
- make layout good, so that all the headers are shown where they should be etc.
- make sure UI is accessible with keyboard
- switch to text edit for markdown notes
- some note text doesn't wrap when browser width gets smaller (ai_general_methods). See why
- "New" could be visible before loading any note
- consider search by multiple tokens from search text
- bring back autosuggest (and consider react-friendly library, but only if it is worth it)
- editor panel with buttons for formatting
- UI optimizations (avoid re-renderings)
- convert to md command for text files
- sign out
- lens icon in search textbox
- cross in search textbox to clean the search text
- title field autocompletes by chrome, it's annoying
- auto-save draft every 3 seconds, if there are changes
- auto-focus on title when note selected? not sure
- auto-focus on text when edit is clicked? (doesn't seem to be easy or possible)
- re-order notes when filtering
- show recent notes in their own section when more than 10 notes visible, ordered by date, latest first
- show new notes in their own section
- show note counter somewhere
